# Car Deformation Test
Car deformation is calculated through:
 ## <br> 0.5 x weight x speed x speed/22500 or 0.5 x weight x speed^2/22500
<br>
<br> It is half of product of weight with square of speed divided by total deformation score.
<br>
This is demonstrated here in JS with five different Cars with Different Weights and Speed.
